Key Takeaways from today, 1/3/26:

Presentation approach: Tell a story around the bullet points rather than just reading slides—the bullets serve as reference for people reviewing later, but the verbal presentation adds context and narrative.

Slide assignments:

Clifton: Problem statement, solution overview, and user journey
James: API integration, CORS error with MyAnimeList (and pivot to Jikan), backend challenges including caching for WatchMode
Anne: DaisyUI challenges and next steps/conclusion
Lynette: Running the slideshow, data filtering piece on HTML (tying it to how backend developers still need front-end skills), and adding PPT link to README

Technical highlights to cover: Caching implementation (unique to your group), the two-step API call process (get media ID, then get details), and how you navigated the CORS issue

Schedule: Dry run Monday, 30 minutes before class (7pm for some, 6:30pm for others). Actual presentation is Wednesday during office hours. Notes and feedback can go in Discord.
