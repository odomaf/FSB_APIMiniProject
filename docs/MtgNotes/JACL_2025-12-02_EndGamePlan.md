**====ACTIONS====**



* js code for dynamically building top 10 list - James
* js code for dynamically building cards - Anne
* js code for sending watchmode titles from jikan and returning javascript objects - Clifton \& Lynette
* modify api call to jikan to use filter parameter instead of type parameter - Clifton \& Lynette

&nbsp;    |----> https://api.jikan.moe/v4/top/anime?order\_by=rank\&filter=favorite

* initial draft powerpoint slides for presentation - Anne



**===DECISIONS===**

* Clifton \& Lynette will use the same names for variables as the apis use, and Anne and James can use those variable names when working on their js code for dynamically including data in top 10 list and cards



Get these items for cards from Watchmode:

* id
* title
* plot\_overview -->collapsible element?
* type
* runtime\_minutes
* release\_date
* genre\_names
* user\_rating
* critic\_score
* poster
* network\_names
* trailer



**===NOTES===**

* Our goal is to have the application finished tomorrow night. This doesn't give us time to also do the powerpoint presentation, so Anne will do an initial draft, and we'll grab some meeting time between Wed and Sat to modify and practice a little. We did not discuss when we would try to meet about the presentation, we kind of forgot and were also running out of meeting time
* Figured out that we need to get favorites from Jikan instead of specific types (like movie names). Mostly putting this note in here to remember for presentation, because it's a part of our story
* Most of our notes were ultimately decisions or action items, so I got nothing else for here, really
