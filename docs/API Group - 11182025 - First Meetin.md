API Group - 11/18/2025 - First Meeting



**\*\*\*DECISIONS MADE\*\*\***

We will be meeting:

* Twice a week
* Tuesdays - 5pCST/6pEST, about 30 -40m, checkin, planning/organizing/logistics
* Sundays -  9amCST/10amEST, 1-2 hours maybe?, code-together working session



OUR PROJECT WILL BE ANIME SOMETHING!!



**\*\*\*ACTIONS\*\*\***

Each of us try getting something out of our chosen anime APIs to share info at next meeting. We're talking simple - just minimal javascript to fetch info and write it to the console so we can explain to each other how our chosen API works. Also come with ideas of what kind of secondary API could go with whatever you worked on. Examples:

- If yours pulls images, could that possibly work with the color palette API we chatted about
- If yours has info on music, could that possible work with Spotify API to generate a playlist of similar music
etc





**\*\*\*NOTES\*\*\***



We discussed all the ideas and possibilities and ideas below before making the above decisions


== Possibilities for API ==

\- Trivia Game?

\- Birds by region?

\- Axolotl facts?

---so many options



Use together possibly: 

\- Art Institute of Chicago

\- Color palette

-- Can pull up for users a piece of art, then feed it into color palette API to get the color palettes



Another use together recipe:

\- Meal recipe API

\- Nutritional information API

-- Can pull recipes and feed into nutritional API to get that information



Consider: 

\- Anime API options?



WHAT ABOUT -- Discord API? Can we get info from API and send to discord for certain kinds of things?



Another Use Together Idea:

\- Anime look up - mood tags?

\- Feed to spotify to generate playlist?




Who will be our target audience? (Apparently, anyone who wants to know more about anime. Like us)



Can we build something that works for us with respect to future projects? For example, color palette could be used in some way to generate color schemes for future projects
